About 2 years ago, it was the first time I studied jekyll. Then I was enrolled at Zhenzhou University for a bachelor's degree. I didn't know much about html, css, js and jekyll. So it was tough for me to learn to build a blog site with jekyll on github. At last I gived it up.

After that, I wrote my blogs on [csdn](http://blog.csdn.net/louislee92). But I am captious on the style of CSDN blog. So I began to write it by myself on github. With my own style sheets and javascript, I can change the theme all the time without any limits. It is so cool in my friends' eyes. But I gived it up again, because it waste lots of time to manage the posts' json file (I save the posts' infomations in a json file).

Now, I back to jekyll again with a different emotion. 2 years, it is neither too long nor too short a time for a human's life. During this time, I learned a lot of knowledge, and truths of life. I have a bad habit that I make plans for something all the time, but most plans I have not carry out it completely. Maybe I am not good at writing a blog, but I will give it a try. 

May everything's gonna be Ok!
